# Blog-Flask
This is the source code for my personal blog, *Blog.VeryFamousDroid()*.

This is very much a work in progress. I can't imagine I'll ever be completely done with it, as I'll be constantly be tweaking things and adding features. As it is, it's workable but kinda ugly, both in design and code. I'm planning on going through in the next few weeks and refactoring things to be better organized.
